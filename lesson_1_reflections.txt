How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? 
 
It zooms into the code that was changed and eliminates a lot of reading code that doesn't have potential bugs in it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

trying new things without having to worry about losing the old working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros - so there aren't too many versions
cons - sometimes i'm forgettful to commit and loses all the changes if computer crashes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

code needs more than one file to sync up

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

figure out if new bugs were accidentally introduced.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can always go back and fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

coding files
